# Gen AI Leader Course Notes

## Foundation models
- Generic, trained on large amounts of data
- Flexible and adaptable
- All LLMs are foundation models

## Data
- Structured (Labeled) vs Unstructured (unlabeled)
  - Labeled: you're able to define relation
  - Unlabeled: the algorithm must find patterns in the data
  - Supervised: use case more obvious
  - Unsupervised: use case to discover new trends in unlabeled/unsupervised data

- Reinforcement learning: good for situations where you can't provide explicit instructions. Example: self-driving cars.
- Grounding: it ties answers to sources. Can ground on specific data, like company data. 
- Knowledge cut off: until what date data was ingested.
