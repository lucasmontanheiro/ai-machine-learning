# Kaggle

How do I improve my Score?
1. Learn more about the data
2. Experiment
   - deign / Create some new features
   - Try different pre-processing
   - Try different types of ML models
   - Combine multiple models (ensemble)
3. Learn from other codes and ideas

## Models

### Random Forest Model
- The model is constructed of several "trees"
- Two ways to potentialize
  - Multiple judges: run same tasks by trees trained slightly different on guessing
  - Different features: different judges use different combination of features
- In the end, it votes for binary YES/NO and come up with veredict
- Whichever receives more votes from trees, win.

### Logistic Regression
- LR is a classification algorithm
- Used to predict a binary outcome (0,1)
- Based on input features (age, gender etc)

## Pre-Processing?

### Class Weights
