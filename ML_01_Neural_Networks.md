## Neural Networks

*Input + Layers + Output*

Neural network is a technique that emulates how our brain cells works: a cell, or neurons, are given and connected -- so they're allowed to exchange information. Then the network is asked to solve a problem and starts trying multiple times, enforcing the connections that lead to success and diminishing the ones the lead to failure.
